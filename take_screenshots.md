# How to Take Screenshots for the README

To complete the README documentation, you'll need to take screenshots of the UI in action. Here's how to do it:

## Required Screenshots

1. **Model Training** (`screenshots/model_training.png`)
   - Run the complete UI: `python complete_mlp_ui.py`
   - Go to the "Train" tab
   - Load some text data and start training
   - Take a screenshot when the training graph shows a clear downward trend

2. **Next Word Prediction** (`screenshots/word_prediction.png`)
   - Go to the "Predict" tab
   - Enter a context phrase (e.g., "the quick brown")
   - Click "Predict Next Word"
   - Take a screenshot showing the prediction results

3. **Text Generation** (`screenshots/text_generation.png`)
   - Go to the "Generate" tab
   - Enter a starting context
   - Set the number of words and temperature
   - Click "Generate Text"
   - Take a screenshot showing the generated text

4. **Model Architecture** (`screenshots/model_architecture.png`)
   - If your UI has a model visualization tab, take a screenshot of it
   - Otherwise, you can skip this one

## How to Take Screenshots

### On macOS:
- Press `Command (âŒ˜) + Shift + 4`, then select the area
- The screenshot will be saved to your desktop
- Rename and move it to the `screenshots` directory

### On Windows:
- Press `Windows + Shift + S`, then select the area
- The screenshot will be copied to your clipboard
- Paste it into an image editor, save it, and move it to the `screenshots` directory

### On Linux:
- Press `PrtScn` or use a tool like `gnome-screenshot`
- Save the image to the `screenshots` directory

## Adding Screenshots to the README

The README.md file already has placeholders for these screenshots. Once you've taken them and placed them in the `screenshots` directory, they should automatically appear in the rendered README on GitHub or other Markdown viewers.

If you need to modify the paths or descriptions, edit the README.md file directly.

## Example Screenshot Workflow

1. Create the screenshots directory if it doesn't exist:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p screenshots
   ```

2. Run the UI:
   ```bash
   python complete_mlp_ui.py
   ```

3. Take the required screenshots and save them with the correct names in the screenshots directory

4. Verify the screenshots appear correctly in the README:
   ```bash
   # If you have a Markdown viewer installed:
   markdown-viewer README.md
   
   # Or view it on GitHub after pushing your changes
   ```
