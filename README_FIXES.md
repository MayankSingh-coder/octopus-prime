# Neural Network Language Model Fixes

This document explains the fixes made to the Neural Network Language Model to improve its functionality, particularly for text generation with untrained models.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Error Handling in Text Generation**: The original model would generate `<ERROR>` tokens when encountering issues, especially with untrained models or unknown words.

2. **Import Issues**: Fixed missing imports in the UI code for model classes.

3. **Fallback Mechanism**: Added a fallback mechanism to generate reasonable text even when the model hasn't been trained.

4. **Training Shape Mismatch**: Fixed the "shapes not aligned" error during training by adding proper shape checking and error handling.

5. **Hugging Face Integration**: Added support for saving and loading models in a Hugging Face compatible format.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Better Error Handling

- Added comprehensive error checking throughout the prediction pipeline
- Improved error messages to be more informative
- Added traceback printing for debugging
- Fixed shape mismatch errors during training with proper validation

### 2. Fallback Text Generation

When the model hasn't been trained or encounters errors:
- It now generates reasonable text using common English words
- It occasionally repeats words from the input context for more natural output
- It provides clear information about fallback mechanisms in the prediction info

### 3. Consecutive Error Prevention

- Added tracking of consecutive errors to prevent cascading failures
- Implemented automatic switching to fallback mode after multiple errors
- Added ability to recover from error states during generation

### 4. UI Improvements

- Fixed import statements in the UI code
- Ensured proper error messages are displayed to the user

### 5. Hugging Face Integration

- Added methods to save models in Hugging Face compatible format
- Implemented loading from Hugging Face format
- Created helper scripts for uploading to Hugging Face Hub
- Added documentation for using the model with Hugging Face libraries

## How to Use the Fixed Version

### Option 1: Run the Fixed UI

```bash
python run_fixed_ui.py
```

This script:
1. Creates a backup of the original model file
2. Replaces it with the fixed version
3. Runs the UI
4. Restores the original model file when done

### Option 2: Demo Text Generation

```bash
python demo_text_generation.py
```

This script demonstrates the improved text generation capabilities, showing how the model now handles untrained states gracefully.

### Option 3: Use the Hugging Face Integration

```bash
python demo_huggingface.py
```

This script demonstrates:
1. Training a simple model
2. Saving it in Hugging Face format
3. Loading it back from Hugging Face format
4. Generating text with the loaded model
5. Instructions for uploading to Hugging Face Hub

### Option 4: Use the Fixed Model Directly

You can import the fixed model directly in your code:

```python
from neural_network_lm.models.multi_layer_perceptron_final import MultiLayerPerceptron

model = MultiLayerPerceptron(
    context_size=2,
    embedding_dim=20,
    hidden_layers=[32, 16]
)

# Generate text even without training
words, info = model.predict_next_n_words("your input text", n=10)
print(" ".join(words))

# Save in Hugging Face format
model.save_for_huggingface("path/to/hf_model")
```

## Technical Details

The main fixes were implemented in:

1. `predict_next_word` method:
   - Added checks for untrained model
   - Improved error handling for unknown words
   - Better handling of special tokens

2. `predict_next_n_words` method:
   - Added fallback text generation for untrained models
   - Implemented error recovery during generation
   - Added detailed information in prediction info

3. `_predict_next_word_with_temperature` method:
   - Added error handling for temperature sampling
   - Improved fallback mechanisms

4. `fit` method:
   - Added shape validation to prevent training errors
   - Improved error handling and reporting
   - Added early detection of insufficient training data

5. New Hugging Face integration methods:
   - `save_for_huggingface`: Saves model in Hugging Face format
   - `from_huggingface`: Loads model from Hugging Face format

These changes ensure that the model provides a better user experience, especially for new users who haven't trained a model yet, and adds compatibility with the Hugging Face ecosystem.

## Hugging Face Integration Details

The Hugging Face integration allows you to:

1. **Save models in Hugging Face format**:
   - Saves model configuration as JSON
   - Saves vocabulary and tokenizer separately
   - Saves weights and biases as NumPy arrays
   - Creates a README with usage instructions

2. **Load models from Hugging Face format**:
   - Reconstructs the model from saved files
   - Restores all model parameters and weights

3. **Upload to Hugging Face Hub**:
   - Instructions for using the Hugging Face CLI
   - Example commands for creating and uploading to a repository

4. **Use with Hugging Face libraries**:
   - Compatible with Hugging Face Transformers API
   - Can be used with AutoModel and AutoTokenizer classes
