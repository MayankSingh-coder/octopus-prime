# Summary of Fixes for the Neural Network Language Model

## Major Issues Fixed

1. **Training Shape Mismatch**
   - Fixed the "shapes not aligned" error during training
   - Added proper validation of input shapes
   - Improved error handling and reporting during training
   - Added early detection of insufficient training data

2. **Context Handling**
   - Fixed issues with context length mismatch
   - Added proper padding for short contexts
   - Added truncation for long contexts
   - Improved handling of unknown words in context

3. **Error Handling in Text Generation**
   - Added comprehensive error checking throughout the prediction pipeline
   - Implemented fallback mechanisms for untrained models
   - Added recovery from error states during generation
   - Improved error messages and debugging information

4. **Hugging Face Integration**
   - Added support for saving models in Hugging Face format
   - Implemented loading from Hugging Face format
   - Created helper scripts for using with Hugging Face ecosystem
   - Added documentation for Hugging Face integration

## How to Use the Fixed Model

### Option 1: Run the Fixed UI
```bash
python run_fixed_ui.py
```

### Option 2: Demo Text Generation
```bash
python demo_text_generation.py
```

### Option 3: Use the Hugging Face Integration
```bash
python demo_huggingface.py
```

### Option 4: Use the Fixed Model Directly
```python
from neural_network_lm.models.multi_layer_perceptron_fixed_final2 import MultiLayerPerceptron

model = MultiLayerPerceptron(
    context_size=2,
    embedding_dim=20,
    hidden_layers=[32, 16]
)

# Generate text even without training
words, info = model.predict_next_n_words("your input text", n=10)
print(" ".join(words))

# Save in Hugging Face format
model.save_for_huggingface("path/to/hf_model")
```
